/// The Wallet acts as a way of coherently interfacing with output descriptors and related transactions. Its main components are:
///     1. Output descriptors from which it can derive addresses.
///     2. A Database where it tracks transactions and utxos related to the descriptors.
///     3. Signers that can contribute signatures to addresses instantiated from the descriptors.
